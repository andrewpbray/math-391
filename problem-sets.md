Weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the reading as well as the 
material that we address in class. You're encouraged to work on the problem sets
with fellow students, though you'll both need to turn in your own work. If you
do collaborate, please add your collaborators name at the top of your work. Problem 
sets are due every **Monday** at the beginning of class.

In terms of the format, you're welcome to turn in handwritten work in addition to
the R code you'll be submitting on the RStudio server. You may find it cleaner,
however, to also do your mathematics on the server as a markdown document containing
LaTeX. For more information about that, please see the resources tab.

I advise you to start working on these early in the week. To aid you in that, the
problems that roughly correspond to a lecture will be indicated on the weekly schedule.

**PS1**: Chapter 1: 1, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 28, 30, 31, 34, 38, 43, 44. Challenge problem:
Solve the more general problem of Buffon's Needle where the wood strips are s units
in width and the needle is h units in length.

**PS2**: Chapter 2: 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 22, 24, 28 (*correction: in problem 24, it should read that the .0238 refers to the women that actually have cancer*).

**PS3**: Chapter 3: 4, 5, 6, 10ab, 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28.

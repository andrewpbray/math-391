Probability

> Probability is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation.
> Laplace, 1819

Probability is a field of mathematics that studies random events. It began ignominiously
when mathematically minded people turned their attention to gambling ("games of chance").
It has developed into a deep body of mathematics that serves as the primary engine
of statistical inference and much of modern science.

This course serves well as an elective within the math major, particularly when 
paired with Mathematical Statistics (MATH 392) in the spring. It will also be useful
for majors in the sciences who utilize probability and statistical reasoning in 
their work.

The course begins with first principles, builds notions of independence, conditioning,
random variables, and explores the properties of the fundamental discrete and 
continuous distributions. There will be a strong problem-solving focus throughout,
with intuition developed by composing analytical solutions alongside computational
ones (in R). Towards the end of the course, we'll look at the major
theoretical results in limits then explore a series of special topics.

### Textbook

[Probability with Applications and R](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) (2014),
by Robert P. Dobrow. The textbook is backordered from the publisher, but you can
access it by:
- Purchase one of the copies in the bookstore.
- Find one online for purchase.
- Check out the copy on reserve at the library.
- Refer to the digital copy via the library website.


### Class components

This course has three components: Problem Sets, Quizzes/Exams, and a Project. For details
on the problem sets, please see the tab at the top of the page.


#### Exams

We'll have several examinations and quizzes throughout the semester in order to challenge your understanding and provide us with a sense of where you're at. Some will be more traditional pen and paper and others are to be done with the computer using R.

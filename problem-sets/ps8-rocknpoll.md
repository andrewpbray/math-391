#### A

Please write out the hypotheses (using proper notation) that would bear on the question of if the observed proportion of supporters of Red in a single poll of 100 people deviates significantly from the true proportion that voted for Red in the last election.

#### B

To evaluate if your observed proportion is consistent with the null hypothesis, you can calculate a p-value, which requires a sense of what the sampling distribution of p-hat looks like. How would you find this sampling distribution?

#### C

Imagine you repeated this hypothesis test on every party for all 8 polls that were conducted. If, in fact, the current voter preferences are exactly what they were in the last election (that is, your null hypothesis is true), how many tests would you expect to still generate a small p-value?

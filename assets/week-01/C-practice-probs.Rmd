#### Question 1
A strand of DNA are made up of a sequence of four nucleotides: As, Cs, Gs, and Ts.
In the double-stranded helix, the A pairs with T, the C with the G. A *palindromic
sequence* is equal to its reverse compliment, e.g. ACGT or GAATTC but not ACCA.

Suppose that all possible strands of DNA of length 6 have equal probability. What
is the probability that one of these strands is a palindomic sequence?

#### Question 2
A bag contains 6 Scrabble tiles: A, D, M, N, O, R. You reach into the bag and take
out one tile at a time. What is the probability that you will spell the word RANDOM?

#### Question 3
Solve the previous problem, but this time, with each draw, you write the letter down
then return it to the bag such that each draw has the full set of 6 letters.

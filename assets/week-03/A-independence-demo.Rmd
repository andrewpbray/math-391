### Practice Problem

Three brands of IPAâ€™s (X , Y , Z ) are to be ranked according to taste by a judge. Let

1. Event A: Brand X is preferred over Y
2. Event B: Brand X is ranked best
3. Event C: Brand X is ranked second best.
4. Event D: Brand X is ranked third best

If the judge is actually a fraud and ranks the beers randomly, is event A independent of B,C, and D?


### Conditional distributions

```{r}
library(mvtnorm)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

n <- 10000
X <- as.data.frame(rmvnorm(n = n, sigma = matrix(c(1, .5, .5, 1), ncol = 2)))
ggplot(X, aes(x = V1, y = V2)) + geom_point()

D <- X %>%
  mutate(X = cut(V1, breaks = c(-5, -1, 0, 1, 5), labels = 1:4), Y = cut(V2, breaks = c(-5, -1, 0, 1, 5), labels = 1:4))

ggplot(D, aes(x = X)) + geom_bar()

D %>%
  filter(Y == 1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = X)) + geom_bar()
```
